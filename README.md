# 游릵 Spring Boot Unit Testing with JUnit, Mockito and MockMvc

* These are my notes while working through Chad Darby's Udemy course on unit testing with the spring framework! 游땕

* I started this course on 15/04/2023 游늰

* You can find the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-unit-testing)

# 游릵 Section 1 - Introduction

## 游릱 Course Introduction

* Spring Boot supports unit test and integration testing vvia JUnit and Mockito

* This course will show you how to take advantage of testing support in Spring

* The course road map consists of:

    1) JUnit Review

    2) Spriong Boot Mocks with Mockito

    3) Spring Boot Testing Spring MVC Web App

    4) Spring Boot Testing Spring REST APIs

## 游릱 Setting up Dev environment

* Dev environment will be intelliJ for Maven support, and MySQL Database Server and Workbench

* I downloaded and installed the MySQL Developer Default setup!

* The source code for this course can be found [here](https://github.com/darbyluv2code/spring-boot-unit-testing)

# 游릵 Section 2 - Unit Testing

## 游릱 2.1 Unit Testing Overview

### 游린 How Do We Typically Write Tests?

* Typically we write small programs which test our code and examine the results. The test case is not reproduceable and we are unable to automate the tests


### 游린 What is Unit Testing?

* 游꾺 Unit Testing is testing individual unit of code. We have a fixed input and expected known output 游꾺

* Suppose we had a calculator program with an `add(int x, int y)` method

    * We would write tests such as:

    1) Does it work with positive?

    2) Does it work with negatives?

    3) Does it work with zero?

#### 游릲 Benefits of Unit Testing:

* Automated tests九덢잺 Better Code Design九덢잺 Fewer bugs and reliability九덢잺

* We can be confident extending/modifying our code 九덢잺

* Great for automated build processes 九덢잺

### 游린 What is Integration Testing?

* 游꾺 Integeration Testing is testing multiple components together as part of a test plan 游꾺

* We can determine if units of code can work together 九덢잺

* We can use mocks and stubbing for integration tests 九덢잺


### 游린 Unit Testing Frameworks

1) JUnit:

    * Supports creating test cases
    * Automation of test cases
    * Utilities for setup and tearing down tests

2) Mockito:

    * Used for creating mocks and stubs
    * Minimise dependencies (such as databases)
